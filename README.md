# 🧰 Digital Frank Box

**Digital Frank Box** is an advanced, software-based Instrumental Transcommunication (ITC) system designed specifically for **paranormal researchers**. Inspired by the original Frank’s Box concept, this application modernizes the methodology by leveraging **global WebSDR (Software Defined Radio)** sources, randomized frequency sweeping, and controlled noise environments.

Unlike traditional hardware-based SBS or spirit boxes, Digital Frank Box is **entirely digital**, platform-independent, and free from the limitations of local broadcast frequencies.

## 🔬 Research-Oriented Design Philosophy

Digital Frank Box was designed with the following research goals in mind:

* Eliminate predictable linear sweep artifacts
* Remove rhythmic audio gaps common in traditional spirit boxes
* Expand signal diversity through **global radio access**
* Allow controlled environmental noise masking
* Provide session repeatability and documentation via recording

The result is a system intended to reduce false auditory patterning while increasing signal complexity for analytical review.

## 📜 Historical Context: Frank’s Box

The original *Frank’s Box* was developed in the early 2000s by paranormal investigator **Frank Sumption** as a tool for Instrumental Transcommunication (ITC) research. The device was designed to rapidly scan AM or FM radio frequencies, briefly sampling fragments of live broadcast audio while being passed through a sophiscated "echo box" to allow electromagnetic interference. It's this interference that Frank believed, allowed entities to communicate through his device.

## ✨ Core Features

* Accesses **hundreds of predefined radio frequencies worldwide**
* Frequencies are selected **non-linearly and randomly**
* Avoids cadence and predictability present in linear sweep devices
* Adjustable sweep timing (milliseconds)

Selectable background noise profiles:

* White Noise
* Pink Noise
* Brown Noise
* Green Noise

Noise can be enabled or disabled depending on research protocol. When enabled, it removes segmented silence between frequency changes.

* Configurable session duration
* Real-time session status monitoring
* Record full sessions for later review

### 🔁 Echo Box Compatibility

* When paired with an external echo box, Digital Frank Box functions as a **fully digital Frank’s Box system**

---

## 🖥️ Supported Platforms

Digital Frank Box is a **desktop application** available for:

* 🪟 Windows
* 🍎 macOS
* 🐧 Linux

> All platforms require an active internet connection for WebSDR access.

---

## 🌐 WebSDR Browser Requirement (Important)

When Digital Frank Box is started, a **browser window or pop-up will automatically open and then minimize itself**. This window is **not an error** and should **not be closed**.

This browser instance is the active **WebSDR connection** responsible for sweeping and streaming global radio frequencies into the application.

### ⚠️ Do Not Close the Browser Window

* The application **cannot function without this WebSDR session**
* Closing the browser window will immediately stop scanning
* Minimization is intentional and handled automatically

If the browser window is closed, Digital Frank Box must be restarted to re-establish the WebSDR connection.
